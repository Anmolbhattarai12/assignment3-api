**Assignment 3- API**
This project demonstrates how to connect to a Third-Party Web API using JavaScript.  
For this assignment, I used TheCatAPI, a free and beginner-friendly API that returns random cat images along with additional breed information.


**Features**
- Fetches a random cat image using **TheCatAPI**.
- Displays extended JSON data including:
  - Breed name  
  - Origin  
  - Temperament  
  - Description  
- Uses the official **Demo API Key** for testing.
- Clean UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Hosted on GitHub Pages for public access.
  **Information**
Breed information is not guaranteed in every API response, and the page displays a fallback message when no breed data is provided.

## API Key Information
This project uses the Demo API Key provided publicly by TheCatAPI
